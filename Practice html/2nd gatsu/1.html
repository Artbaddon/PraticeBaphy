                    Why i like berserk?
                    Berserk is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura. Set in a
                    medieval
                    Europe-inspired dark fantasy world, the story centers on the characters of Guts, a lone
                    mercenary,
                    and
                    Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the "Band of the Hawk". Miura premiered a
                    prototype
                    of
                    Berserk in 1988.

                <div id="box-3"> Gatsu is literally the definition of struggling, he has a brand of sacrifice but what
                    means
                    to having one? it means that all the demons will go after you because you are a mere sacrifice for
                    they,
                    also u have to trust in the casuality if u want to survive. Well if u ask me why u like it?, i will
                    say
                    its because
                    its an analogy for keeping doing it after u fail or i fall, keep struggling until the goal was
                    complete
                    or u die doing it</div>
