            <p>Kaladin Stormblessed is a central character of Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive series. He was born
                as the son of a darkeyed surgeon and raised in the town of Hearthstone, where he would practice to
                become of the same profession as his father. However, the jealousy and spite of a lighteyed nobleman
                towards his father would leave his brother, Tien, forced to join Highlord Amaram's army, where Kal opted
                to throw away his future as a surgeon to protect his sibling.<br />

                Becoming one of the most skilled and notable darkeyed soldiers of Amaram's army, Kaladin would
                eventually fail to protect his brother in a squabble where his brother and several other untrained men
                were used as a distraction. To add on to this, he would later be betrayed by Amaram, who killed his men
                after having saved his life in order to gain the Shardblade Kaladin had won in protecting him. He would
                be branded a slave, and eventually find his way into becoming a bridgeman of Sadeas' army, used as
                fodder for the Parshendi in rushed campaigns to gain gemhearts. His struggles as a part of Bridge Four,
                and his attempts to protect his fellow men instead of losing hope and honor, would eventually lead him
                to bond with the spren, Sylphrena, and realize his powers as a Knight Radiant.</p>
