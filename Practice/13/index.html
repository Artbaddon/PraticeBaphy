            <p>Haki is a mysterious power that allows the user to utilize their own spiritual
                energy for various
                purposes.

                <p> haki, unnamed at the time, was first seen when Shanks used it to scare off the Lord of
                    the Coast to
                    save Luffy when he was a child from the wrath of the Sea King.</p>
                <p> The term "Haki" was first coined
                    and used much later when Blackbeard was commenting on Luffy's bounty in Jaya, and was hinted at
                    during Shanks' visit with Whitebeard.The underlying concepts of Haki were introduced during the
                    Sabaody Archipelago and Amazon Lily Arcs. The concept was clearly explained later on by
                    Rayleigh to Luffy at the start of the latter's training on Rusukaina Island.</p>

                <p>The haki is separated into three categories, The three types of Haki are:</p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Kenbunshoku Haki (見聞色の覇気? Observation Haki)</span>, which gives the user a
                        sixth
                        sense of the world
                        around them, allowing them to sense the presence, strength, and emotions of other people. It
                        also grants limited precognitive abilities, allowing the user to sense their opponents
                        intentions and predict their actions and attacks before they happen
                    </li>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <li><span class="bold">Busoshoku Haki (武装色の覇気? Armament Haki)</span>, which allows the user to
                            use
                            their own spiritual energy as armor to defend against attacks, as well as make their own
                            attacks
                            more potent. It can also be used to bypass Devil Fruit defenses, such as Logia
                            intangibility. A
                            person can apply the armament to a section of their body, over their entire body, and even
                            imbue
                            it onto their weapons.
                    </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>An advanced level of Busoshoku allows the user to emit the armament a short distance
                                without a medium.
                            </li>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            <ul>

                                <li>A higher grade of advanced Busoshoku allows the user to make the emitted armament
                                    flow into a target's body and destroy it from the inside out.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>

                                <li><span class="bold">Haoshoku Haki (覇王色の覇気? Conqueror's Haki),</span> which grants the
                                    user the ability to unleash their own willpower to overpower the will of others.
                                    This
                                    results in victims being mentally overwhelmed by the user, with particularly
                                    weak-willed
                                    foes instantly losing consciousness. Haoshoku is a rare form of Haki that only one
                                    in
                                    several million people are born with the ability to use.</li>

                <p>Devil Fruits have empowered many of the world's most significant individuals, especially among the
                    Three Great Powers. This, along with their general rarity, causes them to be highly sought-after;
                    single specimens may be valued at hundreds of millions in Belly, and extensive efforts have been
                    made to mass-produce artificial versions for warfare. With only one notable exception, an individual
                    can only acquire the powers of a single Devil Fruit and survive.</p>

                <p>As a whole, Devil Fruits encompass hundreds of different powers, from the
                    (apparently) mundane to the inherently mass-destructive.</p>
                <p>These are broadly grouped along three classes: Paramecia, which offer a vast array of strange
                    abilities,
                    Logia, which grant the users the power to become and control natural elements, and Zoan, which allow
                    the
                    users to transform into animals or animal hybrids.</p>
